Description: The ClusterSignificance package provides tools to assess
    if clusters have a separation different from random or permuted
    data. ClusterSignificance investigates clusters of two or more
    groups by first, projecting all points onto a one dimensional
    line. Cluster separations are then scored and the probability
    of the seen separation being due to chance is evaluated using a
    permutation method.
