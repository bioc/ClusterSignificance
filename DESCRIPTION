Package: ClusterSignificance
Title: Investigates Significance of Clusters by Reducing the Data to
        One Dimension to be Able to Easy Set a Score for the
        Separation, and a p-Value is then Calculated from Permutations
        of the Original Data

Description: The ClusterSignificance package provides tools to assess
        if clusters have a separation different from random or permuted
        data. ClusterSignificance investigates clusters of two or more
        groups by first, projecting all points onto a one dimensional
        line. Cluster separations are then scored and the probability
        of the seen separation being due to chance is evaluated using a
        permutation method.
