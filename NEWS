CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.3
-----------------------
    o Adding warn argument to pcp. Mostly for internal use. Fixes the warning with non 		default df argument repeating each perumtation. 
    o Minor plotting improvments including providing a fix for the plot margin error. 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.2
-----------------------

    o Tidying and fixing bugs in README. README now from README.Rmd to
	avoid similar problems in the future. 
    o Adding codecov badge to Readme

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.7.1
-----------------------

    o Updating author info and package URL.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.3
-----------------------

    o Fixed bug in pcp 2D projection plot where colors did not match
        classification plot.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.2
-----------------------

    o Fixed typo in vignette.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
-----------------------

    o added p-value estimate confidence intervals via conf.int function
    o Some vignette updates including adding the "common questions" section.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1
-----------------------

    o Added plotting of individual comparisons in classification and permutation
        plots.
    o Added df argument (degrees of freedom, passed to smooth.spline) to
        projection and permute function. This allows some degree of control over
        how linear or crooked the principal curve is drawn. NOTE: you must (!)
        give the same df value to the projection and permute functions for your
        results to be valid and, at the moment, there is no automated checking
        that this is the case.
    o The classification step now uses a mew method for separation scoring and
        fixes a previous bug which could occur when group sizes were not equal.
        This change is reflected in the vignette.
    o Fixed bug in concatenation c(), when some iterations fail for a specific
        comparison thus causing a error when concatenating permute results.
 
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added a slot for group colors for the classes Pcp, Mlp, ClassifiedPoints
      and PermutationResults


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0

The ClusterSignificance package was born
